        <h2>Decoration day 1885</h2>
        <p> The war was over a <em>civil war</em> that nearly brought a nation to its knees.<br>
            Countless men, young and old alike, gave their lives, not for land, resources, money, <br> even for personal glory.They gave their lives for their ideals.
            A rare moment in history when a soldier got to fight for his believes.
             <br>I fought for the belief that all humankind was free under <em>God</em> I wanted to be a part <br>of something bigger than myself. 
             I wanted to help to bring the human race into the glory of freedom. </p>
        <p>  So I joined the boys in blue, knowing that this decision would cost me, my family.<br> For they believed in Virginia and would fight for her sovereignty. 
            I based my reasoning on morals, and they based theirs on <br>tradition and loyalty. I still remember that day my brother was wearing his typical blue overalls. 
            <br>His bright blue eyes were filled with tears. We embraced for the final time.
             <br>We each knew the likelihood of seeing one another again was slim. I left because I believed in something more significant. 
             I felt like a  martyr giving up something <br>I cared for to pursue the greater good. 
             I just didn’t understand how high that price would be. </p>
       <p> It was <em>December 11th, 1862</em>, where I would fully understand the cost. <br>Our division was to cross a two-mile field under heavy cannon and rifle fire. 
        It was suicide. But we were soldiers. We did what we were told, <br>so we marched slowly.A cannonball hit in the middle of our line three fell.
        Closer and closer, we came to the rebs line. <br>Then a canister shot hit, half of our division fell. Then we were in the range of rifle fire.
        I could see the rebs lowering their guns.<br> It felt like I was court-martialed, then they fired.Three of us still stood.
         I remembered looking down and seeing faces that <br>I knew that I  loved all dead, all gone, never to be seen again. <br> Later I found out that my brother died that same day. 
         So much loss, <br>I began losing my beliefs my values, and I begged for the war to end even if it meant that the wrong side would claim victory. </p>
         <p>  Four years later, the boys in blue won, and now I stood holding my country's great flag watching girls <br>in white dresses put white flowers on other nameless soldiers’ graves.
              All we know about him was that he was one of the thousands who died for his country.
           <br> We don’t know if he cared for the cause or was forced into a conflict that he didn’t understand, and we simply don't know.
